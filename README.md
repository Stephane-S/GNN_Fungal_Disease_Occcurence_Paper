# Repo structure

**Processed_Data/** – prepared tabular datasets for experiments for onion, lettuce and carrot crops and related fungal diseases. Also contains a detailed description of the raw datasets.

**ML_Training/** – Code to generate baseline models using classical machine learning (Decision tree, Random forest, K-nn and FNN)

**Graph_Generation/** – scripts to build plant-level graphs and related utilities

**GNN_Training/** – training/evaluation pipelines for GNN models. Contains ready-to-use graph datasets
